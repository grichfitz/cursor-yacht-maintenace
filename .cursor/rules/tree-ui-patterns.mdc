# Tree UI patterns (Groups + Categories)

When implementing or modifying any UI that **displays a group tree** or **category tree**, keep the presentation consistent with the existing “tree list” style used elsewhere in the app.

- **Prefer**: `TreeDisplay`-based tree layouts and the existing “Editor list” styles (`card`, `card-list`, `list-row`).
- **Avoid**: HTML tables for directory-like lists, and avoid native `<select multiple>` for membership assignment.

## Display rules (read-only or list views)

- **Hierarchy**: show parent/child indentation using the same pattern as editor lists:
  - `paddingLeft: 10 + depth * 18`
  - Child rows use `↳` prefix in the label for visual clarity.
- **Grouping**: if items belong under groups/categories, render them **under their parent node** (like “yachts under groups”), not as a flat list.

## Assignment rules (membership pages)

- **Use** `GenericTreeAssignPage` + `TreeDisplay` for assigning groups/categories via a tree.
- Keep the interaction consistent with existing patterns: checkbox/radio in the tree action area; avoid custom multi-select UIs.

## Dropdown labels for selecting a node

When a user must choose a group/category in a `<select>`:

- **Show path labels** like `Parent › Child` (see the `formatTreeLabel` approach used in editor pages).

## Notes

- Keep UI simple and consistent with existing editor pages.
- Reuse existing components/styles instead of inventing new layouts.
